{"name":"Gnome-desktop","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.gnome.org/gnome-desktop","body":"gnome-desktop\r\n=============\r\n\r\ngnome-desktop contains the libgnome-desktop library, the gnome-about\r\nprogram as well as some desktop-wide documents.\r\n\r\nThe libgnome-desktop library provides API shared by several applications\r\non the desktop, but that cannot live in the platform for various\r\nreasons. There is no API or ABI guarantee, although we are doing our\r\nbest to provide stability. Documentation for the API is available with\r\ngtk-doc.\r\n\r\nThe gnome-about program helps find which version of GNOME is installed.\r\n\r\nYou may download updates to the package from:\r\n\r\n   http://download.gnome.org/sources/gnome-desktop/\r\n\r\nTo discuss gnome-desktop, you may use the desktop-devel-list mailing\r\nlist:\r\n\r\n  http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/desktop-devel-list\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nSee the file 'INSTALL'. If you are not using a released version of\r\ngnome-desktop (for example, if you checked out the code from git), you\r\nfirst need to run './autogen.sh'.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to report bugs\r\n==================\r\n\r\nBugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system:\r\n\r\n   https://bugzilla.gnome.org/ (product gnome-desktop)\r\n\r\nYou will need to create an account for yourself.\r\n\r\nPlease read the following page on how to prepare a useful bug report:\r\n\r\n   https://bugzilla.gnome.org/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html\r\n\r\nPlease read the HACKING file for information on where to send changes or\r\nbugfixes for this package.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
